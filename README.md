# EVOwnership_Classfication

The task is classify a user based on some given input feature vectors and find the target variable. That is, whether the user will be a FCV(Fuel Celled Vehicle) or EV(Electric Vehicle) owner.

First, data pre-processing was done for the dataset (Dataset sourced from University of California Website).
Null values were replaced with mean of the columns.
Outliers were removed.
Oversampling was done to reduce the imbalance in the dataset.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was done.

ML models of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision tree and Random forest were implemented.

Accuracy and other metrics were displayed for each model through confusion matrix.
